# How to autoencode your Pokemon

I wrote a really simple explainer about what autoencoders are and what they can be used for on my Medium post, [How to autoencode your Pokemon](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-autoencode-your-pok√©mon-6b0f5c7b7d97). This is the accompanying code.

This code was built on Parag Mital's excellent course [_Creative applications of Deep Learning with Tensorflow_](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow-iv/) 

The dataset is from the [Pokecommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=267728). I've cropped and converted the image to JPEG for our tutorial.

Have fun!
