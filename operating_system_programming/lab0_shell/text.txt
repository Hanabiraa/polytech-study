Whenever we change the key of an element, it must change its position to go in a place of correct order according to the new key. If the heap is a max-heap and we are decreasing the key, then we just need to check if the key became smaller than any of its children or not. If the new key is smaller than any of its children, then it is violating the heap property, so we will call Heapify on it.
